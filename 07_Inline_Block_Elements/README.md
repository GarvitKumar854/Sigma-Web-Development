# Inline And Block Elements In HTML

## Inline Elements ðŸš€
Inline elements only take up as much width as necessary, and they do not start on a new line. They are typically used for smaller parts of content within a block element, like a single word or a small section of text.

### Examples of Inline Elements:
- `<a>`: Defines a hyperlink.
- `<span>`: A generic inline container for styling and scripting.
- `<img>`: Embeds an image.
- `<strong>`: Defines important text, usually rendered as bold.
- `<em>`: Defines emphasized text, usually rendered as italic.
- `<br>`: Inserts a line break.
- `<input>`: Defines an input control.
- `<label>`: Defines a label for an `<input>` element.
- `<code>`: Defines a piece of computer code.
- `<abbr>`: Defines an abbreviation or acronym.

```html
<span>This is Span</span>
<!-- Used for Links --->
<a href="https://google.com">Google</a>
<img src = "" alt = "Image">

```

## Block Elements ðŸ“¦
Block elements take up the full width available (by default) and always start on a new line. They are used for larger sections of content, such as paragraphs or dividers.


### Examples of Block Elements:
- `<div>`: A generic block container for grouping content.
- `<p>`: Defines a paragraph.
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`: Define headings from level 1 to level 6.
- `<ul>`: Defines an unordered (bulleted) list.
- `<ol>`: Defines an ordered (numbered) list.
- `<li>`: Defines a list item.
- `<table>`: Defines a table.
- `<tr>`: Defines a table row.
- `<td>`: Defines a table cell.
- `<header>`: Defines a header for a document or section.
