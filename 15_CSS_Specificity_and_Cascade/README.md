# CSS Specificity And Cascade

## CSS Specificity
CSS specificity determines which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used in a rule. The specificity hierarchy is as follows (from lowest to highest):

1. Element Selector (`p`, `div`, `span`, etc.)
2. Class Selector (.classname), Attribute Selector (`[type="text"]`), Pseudo-class Selector (:`hover`, :`focus`, etc.)
3. ID Selector (`#idname`)

## Specificity Calculation ðŸ“±
Specificity is often expressed as a number in the format (0,0,0,0), with each component representing a different level of specificity.

- Inline styles have a specificity of (1,0,0,0)
- IDs have a specificity of (0,1,0,0)
- Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes have a specificity of (0,0,1,0)
- Elements and pseudo-elements have a specificity of (0,0,0,1)

**Order of Specificity:** Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector.

**Example:**
```css
/* Specificity: (0,0,1,0) */
p.classname {
    color: red;
}

/* Specificity: (0,1,0,0) */
#idname {
    color: blue;
}
```
In this example, the paragraph with the class `.classname` would be overridden by the rule targeting `#idname` due to higher specificity.

## CSS Cascade Algorithm
The CSS Cascade Algorithm is a process that determines how to apply multiple, potentially conflicting styles to a single element. It considers the importance, specificity, and source order of the CSS rules. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Key Components of the Cascade Algorithm:

1. Importance:
    - `!important`: Overrides all other rules. If a rule is marked with `!important`, it will take precedence regardless of specificity or source order.

2. Specificity:
    - Calculated based on the types of selectors used.
    - Inline styles have the highest specificity.
    - ID selectors are more specific than class selectors.
    - Class selectors are more specific than element selectors.

3. Source Order:
    - When two rules have equal importance and specificity, the one that appears later in the CSS file or HTML document takes precedence.

**Example:**
Consider the following CSS rules:
```css
/* Rule 1: Lower specificity */
p {
    color: blue;
}

/* Rule 2: Higher specificity */
#unique {
    color: red;
}

/* Rule 3: !important */
.important {
    color: green !important;
}

/* Inline style: Highest specificity */
<p id="unique" class="important" style="color: yellow;">Text</p>
```
