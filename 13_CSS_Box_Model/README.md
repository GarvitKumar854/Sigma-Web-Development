# ðŸŒˆ CSS Box Model ðŸ“¦
The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design that describes the structure and layout of HTML elements. It essentially defines how elements are displayed and interact with other elements on a web page. The Box Model consists of four main components:

- Content: The innermost part of the box, where the actual content (text, images, etc.) is placed.
- Padding: The space between the content and the border. Padding adds extra space inside the box, but it is transparent and takes the background color of the element.
- Border: The line surrounding the padding and content. Borders can have various styles (solid, dashed, dotted), widths, and colors.
- Margin: The outermost part of the box, creating space between the element and its neighboring elements. Margins are transparent and do not take the background color of the element.
