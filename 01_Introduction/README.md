Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites or web applications. It involves frontend development for user interfaces, backend development for data processing, and databases for storing information. The internet has become an essential part of daily life, and learning web development empowers individuals to create interactive, scalable, and dynamic websites. Whether for personal projects, businesses, or career growth, mastering web technologies opens up endless possibilities in the digital world.  

## 📌 What is a Website?  

A **website** is a collection of **web pages** hosted on a server and accessible via the internet using a web browser. Websites can be:  
- **Static**: Simple pages that display fixed content (e.g., personal blogs, portfolios).  
- **Dynamic**: Interactive pages that change based on user input or data (e.g., social media, e-commerce sites).  

## ⚙️ How Do Websites Work?  

When you enter a URL like `https://www.example.com` in your browser, a series of processes happen behind the scenes:  

### 1️⃣ Domain Name Resolution 🏷️  
   - The browser sends a request to a **DNS (Domain Name System)** to get the IP address of the website’s server.  

### 2️⃣ Server Communication 🔗  
   - The browser requests the web page from the server using **HTTP/HTTPS** protocols.  

### 3️⃣ Data Transfer & Rendering 🖥️  
   - The server sends the website files (**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.**) to the browser.  
   - The browser reads these files and **renders the webpage visually**.  

### 4️⃣ User Interaction & Updates 🔄  
   - JavaScript runs to handle interactivity (e.g., animations, forms, API calls).  
   - If the website is **dynamic**, it fetches real-time data from a **database or external APIs**.  

## 🏗️ Key Components of a Website  

- **Frontend (Client-Side)**: What users see and interact with, built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**.  
- **Backend (Server-Side)**: Manages data, logic, and user authentication using technologies like **Node.js, PHP, Python, or databases like MySQL/MongoDB**.  
- **Hosting & Deployment**: Websites are hosted on servers using platforms like **GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or AWS**.
